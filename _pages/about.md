Hello, my name is Axel Carayon, i'm a temporary teaching and research assistant at the [ICS team](https://www.irit.fr/recherches/ICS/index.html) from the University of Toulouse, France.

I've defended my PhD **Model-based systematic approach for the engineering of interactive systems: Application to post-stroke rehabilitation** at the [University of Toulouse](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/) in 2025. My work proposed novel approaches to support the engineering of interactive applications, with a specific focus on post-stroke rehabilitation.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Software Engineering, with the goal of building more resilient and maintainable interactive software through user-centered approaches.

# Research Topics and Interests

My main research interests are (but not limited to) :
- Model-based engineering applied to interactive systems
- Input devices and interaction techniques
- User interface programming
- Task modeling

# Research Projects
I have worked on the following research projects :
- [TEAMUP (Task Execution states for Awareness and Monitoring of User Performance)](https://www.irit.fr/recherches/ICS/projects/teamup/) (2022-2026)
- [STRECCC (Study and Recommendations for the Ergonomics of Command and Control Centers)](https://www.irit.fr/recherches/ICS/projects/streccc/) (2023-2024)

# Awards

Best paper award at the Engineering Interactive Computing Systems (EICS) 2022 conference for the paper [Engineering Rehabilitation: Blending Two Tool-supported Approaches to Close the Loop from Tasks-based Rehabilitation to Exercises and Back Again](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593229)
